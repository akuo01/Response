        </h1>
        <p2 class="folk">I enjoyed reading the perspective that author Zach Mandeville provided about coding in his web page. He likens html coding to the rebellious punk and nostalgic folk movements, which, after some thought, makes perfect sense to me. In a virtual world dominated by platforms like Google and Facebook, Mandeville blazes his own path by coding webpages uninformed by contemporary design trends and sensibilities, choosing instead to pay homage to earlier web aesthetics. Moreover, his distinction of separating the state of being online and staying off of major web platforms was really interesting to me. I never considered that the possibility of an organic online experience, where people build sites to their liking and preferences and eventually connect with similarly-minded people to create niche online communities. Itâ€™s a take on the internet that I have never heard of and found highly thought-provoking.
